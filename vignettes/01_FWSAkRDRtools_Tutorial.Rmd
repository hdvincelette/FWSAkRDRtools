The 'FWSAkRDRtools' R package is meant to help users access and manage files on the U.S.
Fish & Wildlife Service Alaska Regional Data Repository (RDR).
The RDR is a "network drive serving as a central location for authoritative project data and deliverables".
Currently, the RDR is internally maintained and can only be accessed by FWS employees connected to the Serviceâ€™s network onsite or through approved remote connection technologies, such as a [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/fws-FF10T00000/SitePages/GlobalProtect-Secure-Technology-Application.aspx).
Connected users can navigate to the RDR by pasting the link <file://ifw7ro-file.fws.doi.net/datamgt/> in File Explorer or a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge or Chrome).
Please refer to the [Draft Regional Data Repository Guidance Document](https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/150400) on ServCat for more information on the overall organization and management of the RDR.
Most 'FWSAkRDRtools' functions require an FWS network connection, and one function also requires write permission to the relevant 'incoming' project folder.

# Workspace

## Uninstall

If you have installed 'FWSAkRDRtools' previously and want to update to the latest version, you may need to uninstall the package first.
Occasionally R hits a roadblock and needs you to manually remove a package before it can proceed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remove.packages("FWSAkRDRtools")
.rs.restartR()
```

## Install

Install the development version of 'FWSAkRDRtools' from GitHub.
The R package 'remotes' (demonstrated here) or 'devtools' is required to install packages from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_STANDALONE="true")
remotes::install_github("hdvincelette/FWSAkRDRtools")

```

## Load

Run the following housekeeping code to set chunk behavior within this document.

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
options(width = 9999)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  error=TRUE
)

```

Load 'FWSAkRDRtools' into the R library and set the working directory (where you would like files to be saved and/or copied from).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(FWSAkRDRtools)

wd<- "C:/Users/hvincelette/OneDrive - DOI/Documents/Data_management/Test"

```

Run the following to access information about 'FWSAkRDRtools' in the Help pane, including documentation pages for each function.
This is a useful quick reference for function usage, arguments, and expected output.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

help(package = "FWSAkRDRtools")

```

# Functions

## `get.dir.template()`: get the directory tree template

This function establishes a new directory using the standardized RDR project folder structure:

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}

rdr_folders <- c("admin", "changelog.txt", "code", "data", "data/final_data", "data/raw_data", "documents", "documents/posters", "documents/protocols", "documents/publications", "documents/reports", "documents/talks", "incoming", "metadata")        

fad_split_up <- strsplit(rdr_folders, "/")

fad_split_up[lapply(fad_split_up, length) > Inf] <- NULL

fad_subbed_out <- lapply(fad_split_up, function(x){
  n <- length(x)
  if (n > 1)
    x[n - 1] <- "|__"
  if (n > 2)
    x[1:(n - 2)] <- "   "
  x <- if (n == 1)
    c("-- ", x)
  else
    c("   ", x)
  x
})

cat(unlist(lapply(fad_subbed_out, paste, collapse = "")), sep = "\n")


```

`get.dir.template()` can help organize a local project to be archived in the RDR.
The project name (`project`) is unrestricted, but a prompt requests approval to overwrite an existing folder with the same name at the local path.
The local path (`local.path`) is where the new directory will be created.
By default, only main project folders are included (`main = TRUE` & `incoming = FALSE`) .
Normally, only data stewards have write permission to the 'incoming' folder of an RDR project, while data managers have write and modify permissions to all folders.
This helps ensure files are not accidentally overwritten and/or lost.
Use `incoming = TRUE` to include the "incoming" folder in the new directory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

get.dir.template(
  project = "mbmlb_909_Eskimo_Curlew_study",
  local.path = wd,
  main = TRUE,
  incoming = FALSE
)

```

<br>

## `find.projects()`: find RDR projects

`find.projects()` queries the RDR for existing project folder names.
Pattern(s) (`pattern)` can be a character string or vector of search term(s).
The default is `pattern = NULL`, which returns results for all project folders.
Patterns must be formatted as "regular expressions", but spaces within a string (e.g., "red knot") are automatically replaced with ".\*?" (e.g., "red.\*?knot") to improve search results.
Patterns are not case-sensitive.
Print `?base::regex` to view the regular expressions R documentation.
The program code (`program`) is an optional argument to fine-tune search results within RDR program folders (fes, mbm, nwrs, osm, sa).
The output will either be the full folder path (`full.path = TRUE`) or just the project folder name(s) (`full.path = FALSE`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

?base::regex

project.folders <- find.projects(
  pattern = c("red.*knot", "alaska"),
  program = "mbm",
  full.path = FALSE
)

```

<br>

## `find.files()`: find RDR project files

`find.files()` allows you to query a specific RDR project folder for individual files.
Pattern(s) (`pattern)` can be a character string or vector of search term(s).
The default is `pattern = NULL`, which returns results for all files.
Patterns must be formatted as "regular expressions", but spaces within a string (e.g., "data dictionary ") are automatically replaced with ".\*?" (e.g., "data.\*?dictionary ") to improve search results.
Patterns are not case-sensitive.
Print `?base::regex` to view the regular expressions R documentation.
A project name or pattern (`project`) is required.
If a pattern is provided and more than one project is found, a menu will ask for a selection.
You can specify the subfolder path (`subfolder.path`) to fine-tune the search results (i.e., search in the "metadata" subfolder for a file name containing "dictionary").
The search can be restricted to the top level of a specified subfolder path (`recursive = FALSE`).
Otherwise, the function will search subsequent subfolders (`recursive = TRUE`).
The search will include both the main (`main = TRUE`) and "incoming" (`incoming = TRUE`) folders unless one or the other is excluded by changing the argument to `FALSE`.
The output will either be the full file path (`full.path = TRUE`) or just the subfolder path(s) and file name(s) (`full.path = FALSE`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}

?base::regex

file.locs <- find.files(
  pattern = c("template", "dictionary", "\\.csv", "hello"),
  project = "mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization",
  subfolder.path = "metadata",
  main = TRUE,
  incoming = FALSE,
  recursive = TRUE,
  full.path = FALSE
)

```

<br>

## `download.files()`: download RDR project files

`download.files()` enables you to download files from specified RDR project folder onto your local drive.
Arguments for `download.files()` operate in the same way as [`find.files()`](https://hdvincelette.github.io/FWSAkRDRtools/articles/01_FWSAkRDRtools_Tutorial.html#find-files-find-rdr-project-files), with a few additions.
The local path (`local.path`) is where the files will be saved.
`download.file.method` is the method for downloading files.
The default (`"auto"`) chooses an appropriate method for the operating system, but the method may need to be specified if the download fails (e.g., `"internal"`, `"libcurl"`, `"wget"`, `"curl"`, `"wininet"`).
Print `?download.file` for more details on download file methods.
Print `browseURL(wd)` to view the downloaded files.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

?download.file

download.files(
  pattern = c("banding", "dictionary"),
  project = "mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization",
  subfolder.path = "",
  local.path = wd,
  main = TRUE,
  incoming = FALSE,
  recursive = TRUE,
  download.file.method = "auto"
)

browseURL(wd)
```

<br>

## `read.tables()`: read RDR project tables into R

`read.tables()` enables you to read tabular data files from a specified RDR project folder directly into R.
Arguments for `read.tables()` operate in the same way as [`find.files()`](https://hdvincelette.github.io/FWSAkRDRtools/articles/01_FWSAkRDRtools_Tutorial.html#find-files-find-rdr-project-files), with a few additions.
`read.tables()` currently only reads XLS/XLSX (via readxl::read_excel) and CSV (via utils::read.csv) table formats.
`na.strings` are any strings that are to be interpreted as NA values.
`header` indicates whether the first line contains variable names.
`header` only applies to CSV formats, and the default is `TRUE`.
`read.tables()` should be used cautiously as most arguments in the dependent functions are set to default values.
Tables should be reviewed for errors and re-imported as needed using the file URLs printed with the output.
`read.tables()` will return a data frame if only one file is selected or a list of data frames if multiple files are selected.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

df <- read.tables(
  pattern = c("dictionary"),
  project = "mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization",
  subfolder.path = "metadata",
  main = TRUE,
  incoming = FALSE,
  recursive = TRUE,
  header = TRUE,
  na.strings = ""
)

df.list <- read.tables(
  pattern = c("\\.csv", "\\.xlsx"),
  project = "mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization",
  subfolder.path = "",
  main = TRUE,
  incoming = FALSE,
  recursive = TRUE,
  header = TRUE,
  na.strings = ""
)

```

<br>

## `clone.project()`: clone an RDR project

```{r, eval=FALSE}

clone.project(
  project = "mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization",
  local.path = wd,
  main = TRUE,
  incoming = TRUE
  )

```

<br>

## `summarize.files()`: summarize files in an RDR project

```{r, eval=FALSE}

file.summary<- summarize.files(
  project = "mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization",
  subfolder = "",
  main = TRUE,
  incoming = TRUE,
  recursive = TRUE
)
```

<br>

## `commit.files()`: commit files to an RDR project

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Note files will only be committed if you are the data steward of the project. Refer to the Data Manager to understand your project roles.

commit.summary<- commit.files(
  project = "mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization",
  local.path = paste0(wd,"/mbmlb_010_Grey_headed_chickadee_hybridization"),
  recursive = TRUE
  )

```
